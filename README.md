In order to collect the textual data needed for Named Entity Recognition, I have scraped all articles on wikipedia darija. The resulting corpus is comprised of 2M+ words, with an abundant amount of named entities. 

The data is now stored on google drive in 63 corpora, with an average of 34,000 words per corpus.

The dataset can be shared with the research community upon demand.
